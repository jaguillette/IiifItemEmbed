# IIIF Toolkit Embeds

This plugin builds on the excellent work done by the
[University of Toronto Libraries](https://github.com/utlib) in their
[IIIF Toolkit](https://github.com/utlib/IiifItems/) plugin for
[Omeka Classic](https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/). It adds easily copyable embed
codes and Mirador viewer links to items and collections, allowing you to use
Omeka to manage your IIIF content and reuse it elsewhere.

The embeddable views come in both Mirador 2.7 and 3.0 flavors, so you can use
whichever version of Mirador you like.

In the future, I hope to add customization options to expose the options
available in Mirador 2 settings and Mirador 3 settings, so if there are
specific customization options you'd like to see, please open an issue in the
repo.
